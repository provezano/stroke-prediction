# Stroke Prediction

Here is my approach to solve Stroke Prediction using the dataset provided by https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.

I'll be using CRISP-DS methodology (with 10 steps) to solve Stroke Prediction. The steps are described below.

(Step 1) Business issue
  
  * "A patient will have a stroke?"
    We want to answer this question based on patient characteristics.
  
  
(Step 2) Business understanding

  * Motivation: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In fact, nearly 800,000 peopleTrusted Source have a stroke each year. That equates to around one person every 40 seconds. (source: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7624)
  
  * Root Cause Analysis: While it's hard to predict a stroke manually, a machine can be used to do this task considering several features and the results can be analyzed by a doctor.
  
  * Solution format: Given some patient characteristics, predict if he'll suffer with a stroke.
  
  
(Step 3) Data collection
  
  * This step was already done. The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.
